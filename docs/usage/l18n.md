# drip-form-validator l18n.

drip-form-validator supports internationalization.  
You can load locales and easily switch between them.

However, there are few locales that are still supported.  
PR is welcomed.


## Example

The following is an example of switching to Japanese.

```javascript
import { Validator } from 'drip-form-validator';
import 'drip-form-validator/lib/locale/ja'; // Load locale file

Validator.setLocale('ja');
```


## Definition of your locale

Please specify the message corresponding to the rule name.

```javascript
Validator.defineLocale('localeName', {
  // `defaultMessage` is required field.
  defaultMessage: 'The {{field}} field is invalid.',

  // It is a normal designation method.
  // The key `field` will definitely come across.
  // Other parameters are parameters passed to the rule.
  alpha: 'The {{field}} may only contain letters.',

  // It is also possible to change the message according to the value type.
  between: {
    defaultMessage: 'The {{field}} must be between {{min}} and {{max}}.',
    string: 'The {{field}} must be between {{min}} and {{max}} characters.',
    array: 'The {{field}} must be between {{min}} and {{max}} items.',
  },

  // It is also possible to pass functions.
  ruleName: (field, value, params) => `The ${field} field value is ${value}, params = ${JSON.stringify(params, null, '  ')}`,
});
```
